# Getting Started With Redux

## Learning Goals

Get (re)-introduced to redux with Dan Abramov.

Watch the [Video Series](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) on redux. It's about 2 hours of 2-8 min videos.

As you watch, try to write code samples that match up to the examples demonstrated in the videos.
